# Hotel booking demand prediction

## Task 3 Proposal

This is our project for Hanyang Fall 2020 AI class. This Project is not connected to any SE-project.

We want to use historical hotel booking data to predict demand for specific week days. This could help hotel owners price their rooms for maximized ocupancy and increase their revenues. This effort is ment to help the hard hit hotel industry in times of corona.

We hope to find out more about the booking behaviour of costumers throughout the year. In additon, we'd like to create some graphs about the general occupancy of hotels by weekday.

We would like to achive this using random forrest. Noone of us has ever used random forrest before but we hope to gian some experience and understanding in the process of this project.

## Task 4
Find the related (previous) works to your proposal and/or tools (software or services) that you can use. Provide a summary.
Provide a paragraph with exact references: URLs, publications, and etc.
Submission: Update the google doc, convert your blog to PDF, and submit to blackboard (one submission per group).
*** Topic Proposal Guideline (Option A or B):
When you choose your topic to work on, you can choose one of the following options:
Option A: Take a very similar step like Kaggle’s Titanic example, you will show us how to investigate the dataset of your choice. You can choose one of the methods from the AI/Machine learning/DL libraries (e.g., https://scikit-learn.org/stable/, R - https://cran.r- project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html, Weka - https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/, Neural Network packages, AWS Sage maker https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/, and many others.). You will show us a step-by-step procedure on how to do learning. Accuracy of your method does not matter in this project. Our assignment 2 is giving you a preview of what your project is going to be like.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/as-sah/Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/as-sah/Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
